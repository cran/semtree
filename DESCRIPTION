Description: SEM Trees and SEM Forests -- an extension of model-based decision
    trees and forests to Structural Equation Models (SEM). SEM trees hierarchically
    split empirical data into homogeneous groups each sharing similar data patterns
    with respect to a SEM by recursively selecting optimal predictors of these
    differences. SEM forests are an extension of SEM trees. They are ensembles of
    SEM trees each built on a random sample of the original data. By aggregating
    over a forest, we obtain measures of variable importance that are more robust
    than measures from single trees. A description of the method was published by
    Brandmaier, von Oertzen, McArdle, & Lindenberger (2013; <doi:10.1037/a0030001>) 
    and Arnold, Voelkle, & Brandmaier (2020; <doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2020.564403>).
